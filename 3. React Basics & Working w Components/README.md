## Components
Individual reusable with seperated concerns building blocks composed together into an interface

Smaller pieces = easier to maintain

Reusable: dont repeat yourself

Seperation of concerns: dont do too many things in one and the same place(function)


## React Code Written In A Declarative Way

Define the desired target state and under which conditions it should be reused & React determines which elements actual JS DOM updates


## CODE LINKS

use node@16, via symlink
